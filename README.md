# Web-Navigator-AI-Agent
OneAgent is an autonomous web agent using a local LLM (e.g., via Ollama) and Playwright/Puppeteer for entirely offline, natural language-driven web automation. It executes complex tasks like data extraction and form filling directly on the user's machine, ensuring maximum data privacy, zero API costs, and low latency.
